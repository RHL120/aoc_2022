# aoc_2022
Here you can find my solutions to aoc 2022. I am going to try to solve most of the challanges in rust (because it is my newest and least favorite langauge)
and as few challanges as possible in haskell (becuase it is my favorite langauge). The solutions work but they are not clean I thought about making them cleaner but then remembered that writting clean code in rust takes too much time.
